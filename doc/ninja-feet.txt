INTRODUCTION                                    *ninja-feet*

ninja-feet.vim provides the means to operator from the cursor to either
the beginning or end of a text object.

The mappings presently only work in |Operator-pending| mode.

MAPPINGS                                        *ninja-feet-mappings*

                                                *o_[* *ninja-left-foot*
{operator}[{motion}     Perform {operator} from the cursor to the beginning
                        of the text object defined by {motion}. Only text
                        object motions (starting with `i` or `a`) are valid.


                                                *o_[* *ninja-left-foot*
{operator}]{motion}     Perform {operator} from the cursor to the end of the
                        text object defined by {motion}. Only text object
                        motions (starting with `i` or `a`) are valid.


EXAMPLES                                        *ninja-feet-examples*

    d]i(                Delete from the cursor to the end of a parenthetical
                        term.

    c[a"                Change from the cursor to the beginning of a quoted
                        string (including the `"` character).

ninja-feet.vim can also work with custom operators and text objects. Consider
the following example using lion.vim (https://github.com/tommcdo/vim-lion) and
dentures.vim (https://github.com/qstrahl/vim-dentures):

    gl]ii=              Align from the cursor to the end of the indent block by
                        the `=` character.

Caution: Only a true ninja can steal a lion's dentures.
